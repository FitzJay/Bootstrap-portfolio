              <p> My name is Eli, and I am entering my last year online at ASU. My major is in Public Service and Policy with an emphasis in Emergency Management and Homeland Security. When I finish my degree at ASU, I hope to work for organizations that help with disaster relief and prevention. I am taking this course as a skill set that I want to develope for my future career. Emergency management will evolve in the next few years to becoming a profession where online development will be key.  Born in Colorado, but raised in Phoenix, I love the Arizona weather, and enjoy the outdoors. My hobbies include swimming, hiking, online computer games, playing Magic the Gathering, and finding worthwhile service opportunities.  I hope to find more secure work after the semester ends. I found this career path in a search to find purpose in my life, after long bouts with depression, and anxiety. I needed to find a career field that I could focus on, and help others, instead of constantly worrying about myself. My fun fact about myself will be that I spent two years in Mexico, where I learned to speak Spanish fluently, walked everywhere I needed to go 90% of the time, and once ate two habanero peppers within 10 minutes of each other and lived to tell the tale. I am very excited to interact with each of you.
